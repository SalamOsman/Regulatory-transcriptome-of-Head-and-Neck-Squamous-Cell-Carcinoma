Regulatory-transcriptome-of-Head-and-Neck-Squamous-Cell-Carcinoma

This script can be used for importing cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), normalization of the count data, 
identification of diffrential expressed RNAs, enrichemnt and survival analysis. The main objective of this pipeline is to explore 
the regulatory network of RNAs involving in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). This script can be editied for any dataset
that is available in TCGA repository.
